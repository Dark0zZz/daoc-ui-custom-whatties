Thank you for downloading Whattie's PodMod for DAOC. I've done my best to keep it as close to the original as possible.

This is a very minimalistic UI but I did add in the option to change icon sets.

If you have any problems with the UI, find something that I overlooked, or just have a question
please let me know. You can contact me in game on Belkiolle of Albion Ywain, Brimond of Midgard Ywain, 
Belk of Hibernia Ywain, or through e-mail at belkiolle2001@gmail.com.
