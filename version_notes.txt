6/30/06 patch notes
v1.84
- The spell panel in the default UIs will no longer cut off spells with long names. Because of the recent internal changes with this control, custom UI authors should check that “Column1Width” of their spell panel tree is wide enough to display long spell names.



6/27/06 Custom UI Support Information


In addition, the IconDef control now supports the following tags:

- LabelAdapterName which takes a TextAdapter and updates the label on the icon

- StateAdapterName which takes a ScalarAdapter and offsets the position of the icon down and to the right by the scalar

- OnClickEvent which allows icons to handle click events

- HideLabel which, if set to 1, will hide any label data

IconDef can now take ToolTipID 38, which will create a tool tip containing the Icon's label information.




7/1/06

copied over the following files into the custom directory and made changes to fit Whattie's UI:
 new_quest_journal_window.xml
 new_quest_finish_window.xml
 new_quest_window.xml

added reward_frame_template to styles.xml to support the new quest window
